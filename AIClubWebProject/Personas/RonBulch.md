Bio
Lives with his parents, works part time since high school or before. Started community college to get some college credits and save money. Recently decided on a path for school. Ronald wants to focus on getting good grades and balance schoolwork with work hours, which leaves less time to try and navigate all the extra things like billing, registration, and viewing class schedules. Ron is looking forward to getting out and living on his own and realizes LCC is a big step towards doing that. He is introverted, and he enjoys doing things in nature with his friends.
