# Welcome to the LCC AI Club Web Project!
### Our goal is to create a navigational bot to assist users navigating the lcc.edu website.


## Project: lcc.edu StarBot

### Abstract:

LCC.edu is a large website that is meant to serve a broad community and provide information about Lansing Community College. There are multiple external affiliated sites that users typically need to use, particularly for students. The LCC.edu NavBot will provide a smart and adaptable method to assist users in navigating not only LCC.edu but also the affiliate sites like D2L and Banner Self Service, for example. It should be able to adapt to the user in order to provide personalized assistance with navigating the site, links, and doing things like registering for classes and guidng tuition payments. 

### 4/20/22 Meeting Plan
**Goal: begin a sprint with at least measurable and documentable research tasks**
