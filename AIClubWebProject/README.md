### **To Dos:**
Starting 2/23/22 our main goal is going to be to mock up personas 

Club members/Project builders/creators should submit a fully worked persona to use as a potential primary persona, and to build out a "user" base.
Follow Link under Creating Personas under the References section and make sure to include the following:
 - Bio
 - Demographics
 - Needs
 - Goals
 - Frustrations/pain points
 - Technology
 - Hobbies/Interests
 - Brands

The best persona is the most complete persona for initial development purposes. More will be needed and utilized as the project continues

Determine what kind(s) of AI/ML we are going to use, and how- 
  - NLP for the chatbot
  - Recommendations - TBD
  - Web crawling, search assistance
    - D2L navigation
      - Email and notification, reminders
    - Banner Self Service
    - 5star
    - myLCC
    
Determine UI/UX components for the end user to interact with

### 2/23/22 Scope planning meeting

Primary objective is to have a documented scope to follow and plan within, so project components can get divided up.
