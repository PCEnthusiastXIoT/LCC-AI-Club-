# Welcome to the LCC AI Club Web Project!
## Our goal is to create a navigational bot to assist users navigating the lcc.edu website.


### Project Name:
LCC.edu NavBot

### Abstract:

LCC.edu is a large website that is meant to serve a broad community and provide information about Lansing Community College. There are multiple external affiliated sites that users typically need to use, particularly for students. The LCC.edu NavBot will provide a smart and adaptable method to assist users in navigating not only LCC.edu but also the affiliate sites like D2L and Banner Self Service, for example. It should be able to adapt to the user in order to provide personalized assistance with navigating the site, links, and doing things like registering for classes and guidng tuition payments. 

### 3/2/22 Meeting

Created initial persona as a starting point to iterate over and create more, started Kathy Paul as a second persona

Pulled Data to assist persona development: 
- 18-21 is the largest age bracket
- 22-29 is the second largest
- 30-39 is tied for third with 50 & over

The primary persona is going to drive development of the app in its inception and be used to define the initial design of the application.

**Personas wanted:**
- Prospective student
- Second time student

**Customer/stakeholders:**

LCC AI Club


**End users/target audience:**
LCC Student Body

LCC Affiliates
LCC Alumni

### To Dos:

Create more personas to choose from as a primary persona

Club members/Project builders/creators should submit a fully worked persona to use as a potential primary persona, and to build out a "user" base.
Follow Link under Creating Personas under the References section and make sure to include the following:
 - Bio
 - Demographics
 - Needs
 - Goals
 - Frustrations/pain points
 - Technology
 - Hobbies/Interests
 - Brands

The best persona is the most complete persona for initial development purposes. More will be needed and utilized as the project continues

Start some mockups based on the persona's that are most likely to end up as primary

Determine what kind(s) of AI/ML we are going to use, and how- 
  - NLP for the chatbot
  - Recommendations - TBD
  - Web crawling, search assistance
    - D2L navigation
      - Email and notification, reminders
    - Banner Self Service
    - 5star
    - myLCC
    
Determine UI/UX components for the end user to interact with

### 2/23/22 Scope planning meeting

Primary objective is to have a documented scope to follow and plan within, so project components can get divided up.
