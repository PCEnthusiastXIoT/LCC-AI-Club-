# Welcome to the LCC AI Club Web Project!
## Our goal is to create a navigational bot to assist users navigating the lcc.edu website.


### Project Name:
LCC.edu StarBot

### Abstract:

LCC.edu is a large website that is meant to serve a broad community and provide information about Lansing Community College. There are multiple external affiliated sites that users typically need to use, particularly for students. The LCC.edu NavBot will provide a smart and adaptable method to assist users in navigating not only LCC.edu but also the affiliate sites like D2L and Banner Self Service, for example. It should be able to adapt to the user in order to provide personalized assistance with navigating the site, links, and doing things like registering for classes and guidng tuition payments. 

### 3/30/22 Meeting Plan
**Goal: begin a sprint with at least measurable and documentable research tasks**
- Discuss progress anyone may have made on our To Do's after last week's meetings
- Create at least three issues that can be contributed towards via GitHub
- Decide what UI we will focus on for Kathy Paul
- Come up with an entry point or iterable start to a web crawler/simple chatbot so one could be built by next week
- End meeting with some small deadlines, likely requiring the site diagram

### 3/23/22 Meeting

- Finished Kathy Paul's persona
- Created Edward Carter
- Decided Kathy Paul will be primary persona

### To Do's

- Diagram the LCC Website and affiliates
- List other websites offering relevant information (scholarships, FAFSA, etc)
- Lists of FAQ's regarding LCC.edu from students
- Create a web crawler for indexing
- Create a simple chatbot prototype with GUI
- Create AWS API to power the interface

- Make a shareable doc for top three items
- GUI/API could be a bundle job
- Web Crawler can be done concurrently as well
