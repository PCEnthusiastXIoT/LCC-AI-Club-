# Welcome to the LCC AI Club Web Project!
## Our goal is to create a navigational bot to assist users navigating the lcc.edu website.

### 2/23/22 Scope planning meeting

Primary objective is to have a documented scope to follow and plan within, so project components can get divided up.

## 3/2/22 Goals

Have multiple personas to choose a primary persona from.
The primary persona is going to drive development of the app in its inception and be used to define the initial design of the application.



**Project Name:**
LCC.edu NavBot


**Customer/stakeholders:**
Lansing Community College Staff
LCC Faculty
LCC AI Club


**End users/target audience:**
LCC Student Body
LCC Faculty
Prospective LCC Students
LCC Affiliates
LCC Alumni

**Abstract:**
Artificial Intelligence is becoming the way of right now rather than a goal of the future.  



### **To Dos:**
Starting 2/23/22 our main goal is going to be to mock up personas 

Club members/Project builders/creators should submit a fully worked persona to use as a potential primary persona, and to build out a "user" base.
Follow Link under Creating Personas under the References section and make sure to include the following:
 - Bio
 - Demographics
 - Needs
 - Goals
 - Frustrations/pain points
 - Technology
 - Hobbies/Interests
 - Brands

The best persona is the most complete persona for initial development purposes. More will be needed and utilized as the project continues

Determine what kind(s) of AI/ML we are going to use, and how- 
  - NLP for the chatbot
  - Recommendations - TBD
  - Web crawling, search assistance
    - D2L navigation
      - Email and notification, reminders
    - Banner Self Service
    - 5star
    - myLCC
    
Determine UI/UX components for the end user to interact with
