# Welcome to the LCC AI Club Web Project!
## Our goal is to create a navigational bot to assist users navigating the lcc.edu website.

Right now, our goals are as follows:

1. Familiarize ourselves with the site, and document navigation paths.
2. Research Web Crawlers that can be run with machine learning/AI.
3. Create a plan for implementing a smart system to learn the lcc.edu site.
4. Implement and test the system; integrating with a chatbot to assist interfacing
5. Fine tune the system and work towards implementing it on the actual site!
